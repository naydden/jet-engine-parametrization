abstract = {Since the beginning, Clusterin (CLU) was revealed not as simple to$\backslash$nstudy, and certainly not a single protein. The growing research interest$\backslash$non CLU soon produced many contributions by independent laboratories$\backslash$nworking in different systems. Thus, many different names or acronyms$\backslash$nhave been given to CLU in the early years after its discovery. Now,$\backslash$na general consensus recommend the name Clusterin and the abbreviation$\backslash$nCLU. CLU was first described as a glycoprotein found nearly ubiquitous$\backslash$nin tissues and body fluids. This early knowledge is mostly related$\backslash$nto the secretory form of CLU (sCLU), which is exported from the cell$\backslash$nand released in secretions acting as an extracellular chaperone.$\backslash$nBut CLU can also enter the nucleus. The detection of nCLU (nuclear$\backslash$nCLU), which is usually associated to cell death, is now emerging$\backslash$nas a very important event making this issue even more complex. This$\backslash$nmay explain why CLU is still often described as an "enigmatic" protein.$\backslash$nThe use of the term "enigmatic" is a clear indication that too many$\backslash$naspects related to the biological function(s) of CLU and its possible$\backslash$nrole in pathogenesis have been obscure, or very difficult to interpret,$\backslash$nfor long time. Contradictory findings on CLU are also present in$\backslash$nthe literature, sometimes due to technical biases or alternative$\backslash$ninterpretation of the same result. The aim of the book is ambitious:$\backslash$nthrough a careful review of old data, in the light of novel information$\backslash$nand up to date methods and hypotheses, we will try to simplify the$\backslash$npicture for the reader and bring more light in a field still perceived$\backslash$nto be too obscure to fully appreciate its importance and potential$\backslash$nimplementation in the clinical setting. This introduction will provide$\backslash$na brief general history and a critical view of the discovery of CLU$\backslash$nwith the aim to underline what is new in the field and what is now$\backslash$nobsolete. In the rest of the book, conclusions and "take home messages"$\backslash$nwill also be provided to the reader particularly focusing on possible$\backslash$nclinical implementations and how all this knowledge will very likely$\backslash$nbring novelty in the fight against cancer.},
